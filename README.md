## About the Project

This project was born from a deeply personal place.

Growing up, I witnessed my brother and sister battle Sickle Cell Disease. I saw the hospital visits, the pain crises, the emotional toll on family, and ultimately, I lost them both in their early 20s.

This website exists to honor their memory, reduce misinformation, and help others better understand Sickle Cell Disease — not just as a medical condition, but as a lived experience.
